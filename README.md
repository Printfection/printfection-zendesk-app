## Zendesk App from Printfection to Generate Gift URLs in a Ticket

This Zendesk app allows users to specify their **Printfection API Key** and **Printfection Giveaway Campaign ID** in the app settings. From there Zendesk users can then generate Gift URLs right inside Zendesk tickets. Gift URLs are returned neatly within a lightbox modal where the link can easily be copied.

### Using the App

In Zendesk you can go to any existing ticket and see the Printfection section in the sidebar. There's a button to **Get a New Gift URL**, when you click it you will be presented with a brand new Giveaway Gift Link from your campaign. You can easily copy it and add it to the ticket.
